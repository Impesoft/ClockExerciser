**WHY CLOCK EXERCISER?**

In our digital age, analog clock reading is becoming a lost skill. Clock Exerciser makes learning fun, interactive, and effective through gamification and immediate feedback. With support for both English and Dutch languages, learners can practice in their preferred language.

**TWO ENGAGING GAME MODES**

🕐 **Clock to Time Mode**
Look at the animated analog clock and type what time you see. Use digital format (3:15) or natural language (quarter past three, kwart over drie). The app accepts multiple formats to match how you naturally think about time!

⏰ **Time to Clock Mode**
See the time in digital and text format, then set the clock hands by dragging intuitive sliders. Perfect for understanding the relationship between digital and analog time representation.
